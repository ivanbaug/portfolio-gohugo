# portfolio-gohugo

Portfolio, this time using Hugo static site generator.

- The UI imitates the Julia Programming Languaje webpage https://julialang.org/ , took it as reference because it just looks clean and pretty sober.

- With Hugo it will hopefully render faster as a static site, also, it will be easier to deploy minor changes like adding a bit more content once in a while.

- Works well even if the browser doesn't support javascript or blocks it :)
